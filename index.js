 *  - Make sure your request is receiving multiple array items!
 *  - Check the API documentation if you're only getting a single object.
 * - For each object in the response array, create a new element for the carousel.
 *  - Append each of these new elements to the carousel.
 * - Use the other data you have been given to create an informational section within the infoDump element.
 *  - Be creative with how you create DOM elements and HTML.
 *  - Feel free to edit index.html and styles.css to suit your needs, but be careful!
 *  - Remember that functionality comes first, but user experience and design are important.
 * - Each new selection should clear, re-populate, and restart the Carousel.
 * - Add a call to this function to the end of your initialLoad function above to create the initial carousel.

 * - Hint: Axios has the ability to set default headers. Use this to your advantage

 *   send it manually with all of your requests! You can also set a default base URL!
